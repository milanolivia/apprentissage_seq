    "## First steps with the Gym interface\n",
    "\n",
    "An environment that follows the [gym interface](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) is quite simple to use.\n",
    "It provides to this user mainly three methods, which have the following signature (for gym versions > 0.26):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `reset()` called at the beginning of an episode, it returns an observation and a dictionary with additional info (defaults to an empty dict)\n",
    "- `step(action)` called to take an action with the environment, it returns the next observation, the immediate reward, whether new state is a terminal state (episode is finished), whether the max number of timesteps is reached (episode is artificially finished), and additional information\n",
    "- (Optional) `render()` which allow to visualize the agent in action. Note that graphical interface does not work on google colab, so we cannot use it directly (we have to rely on `render_mode='rbg_array'` to retrieve an image of the scene).\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood, it also contains two useful properties:\n",
    "- `observation_space` which is one of the gym spaces (`Discrete`, `Box`, ...) and describe the type and shape of the observation\n",
    "- `action_space` which is also a gym space object that describes the action space, so the type of action that can be taken\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to learn about [gym spaces](https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/spaces/) is to look at the [source code](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/tree/main/gymnasium/spaces), but you need to know at least the main ones:\n",
    "- `gym.spaces.Box`: A (possibly unbounded) box in $R^n$. Specifically, a Box represents the Cartesian product of n closed intervals. Each interval has the form of one of $[a, b]$, $(-\\infty, b]$, $[a, \\infty)$, or $(-\\infty, \\infty)$. Example: A 1D-Vector or an image observation can be described with the Box space.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example for using image as input:\n",
    "observation_space = spaces.Box(low=0, high=255, shape=(HEIGHT, WIDTH, N_CHANNELS), dtype=np.uint8)\n",
    "```                                       \n",
    "\n",
    "- `gym.spaces.Discrete`: A discrete space in $\\{ 0, 1, \\dots, n-1 \\}$\n",
    "  Example: if you have two actions (\"left\" and \"right\") you can represent your action space using `Discrete(2)`, the first action will be 0 and the second 1."
